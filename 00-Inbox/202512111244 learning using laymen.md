## Quick Capture
To learn new chapters, don't just start reading from the first heading onward. Scan the chapter, note the keywords, use an AI tool to ask :

> I am learning * THIS TOPIC*, here are the keywords that I will have to learn about. Explain these to me in laymen's terms so it's simple for me understand.

You can also use image search when figures are relevant.
## Context
- [How To Absorb Everything You Read Like A Sponge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu7Yqxlc3ec)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Process into permanent note
